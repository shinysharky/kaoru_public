## ˚˖𓍢🌷✧˚.🎀⋆ Future Projects
### ˎˊ˗ mood

### ˎˊ˗ jokes
- What it does: Greets users, responds to simple messages like "how are you?" or "tell me a joke".
- Skills learned: Handling messages, basic logic.
- Bonus: Use a free joke API to fetch random jokes (https://official-joke-api.appspot.com)

### ˎˊ˗ Mystery Box 
- Create a mystery box that offers users an item, gift, or funny reward at random. 
- This can be something like
  * virtual items
  * titles (roles that get show on the side)
  * special roles (they get automatically) 
  * virtual pets(?)
  * inside jokes
- Example Rewards:
  * "Congratulations! You've unlocked a limited-time badge: 'Professional Procrastinator.'"

### ˎˊ˗ Love Letters
- Send a random “love letter” from the bot to a user or a group.
- You can either make it dramatic, funny, or even embarrassing.
- Example Love Letters:
  * "Dearest {user}, your presence lights up the room brighter than a million stars. I shall never forget our first taco Tuesday together."
  * "Roses are red, violets are blue, I can't stop thinking about the sandwich we shared last Tuesday. Your sandwich sharing skills are legendary."

### ˎˊ˗ Random Question
- Ask users a random fun or deep question.
- It could be lighthearted or introspective.
- Let them respond and chat about it.
- Example Questions:
  * "If you could have any superpower for one day, what would it be?"
  * "What’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever believed as a kid?"

### ˎˊ˗ Would you rather
- This can be a hilarious and engaging command.
- Give users a “would you rather” question and let them pick an option.
- You can also make the choices fun, outrageous, or absurd.

  * "Would you rather always be 10 minutes late or always be 20 minutes early?"

### ˎˊ˗ Truth or Dare
