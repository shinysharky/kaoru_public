## ˚˖𓍢🌷✧˚.🎀⋆ Future Projects

### ˎˊ˗ mood
- What it does: Asks users how they feel, then replies with an encouraging message.
- Skills learned: Natural language (basic), customizing responses.
- Bonus: Add emojis or gifs using a simple API or file set.

### ˎˊ˗ jokes
- What it does: Greets users, responds to simple messages like "how are you?" or "tell me a joke".
- Skills learned: Handling messages, basic logic.
- Bonus: Use a free joke API to fetch random jokes (https://official-joke-api.appspot.com)

### ˎˊ˗ Mystery Box 
- Create a mystery box that offers users an item, gift, or funny reward at random. 
- This can be something like
  * virtual items
  * titles (roles that get show on the side)
  * special roles (they get automatically) 
  * virtual pets(?)
  * inside jokes
- Example Rewards:
  * "Congratulations! You've unlocked a limited-time badge: 'Professional Procrastinator.'"

### ˎˊ˗ Random Question
- Ask users a random fun or deep question.
- It could be lighthearted or introspective.
- Let them respond and chat about it.
- Example Questions:
  * "If you could have any superpower for one day, what would it be?"
  * "What’s the most ridiculous thing you’ve ever believed as a kid?"

### ˎˊ˗ Would you rather
- This can be a hilarious and engaging command.
- daily one question by default (if set up) -> 365 Questions, and everyday is a different one
- Give users a “would you rather” question and let them pick an option.
- 2 Choices -> React to vote (bot reacts with two server emotes by default)
- Example Questions:
  * "Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or one horse-sized duck?"
  * "Would you rather always be 10 minutes late or always be 20 minutes early?"

### ˎˊ˗ Truth or Dare
- This command could be a fun icebreaker!
- The bot asks users to choose "truth" or "dare," then generates a random question or challenge for them. (clickabel truth and dare)
- Example Truths:
  * "What’s the most embarrassing thing you’ve done in public?"
  * "Tell us a secret you’ve never told anyone."
- Example Dares:
  * "Sing a song in VC!"
  * "Share a meme in the chat!"
